This program implements a node process running in a distributed system. It runs an MAP protocol and uses
Lamport Snapshot protocol to detect termination of the MAP protocol. A protocol is then implemented to bring all nodes
to a halt.

The launcher.sh script logs into the specified machines and starts each node individually. It uses
UT Dallas dcXX distributed systems servers.

A config file is supplied to determine the distributed system topology, host names, ports and application
parameters.

Compile the program:

make

Run the program:

./node nodeID config_file

example: ./node 2 config.txt
